# Reflection

1. Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of often merging code changes into a shared repository with automated tests to catch errors early. Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) ensures the software is automatically prepared or released to production once checks are passed for faster, reliable updates.

2. Automation reduces mistakes, saves time, and boosts efficiency by handling repetitive tasks like testing, building, and deploying, allowing developers to focus on problem-solving and new features.

3. CI/CD pipelines improve teamwork by ensuring consistent integration and testing, reducing conflicts, and detecting bugs early. They also give teams visibility into the project’s status at any time.

4. Challenges include setting up the pipeline correctly, managing dependencies, handling environment issues, and making sure pipeline steps match the project’s needs.
